# Glued

**Glued** is a tiny macOS menu bar app that keeps your AirPods (AirPods Pro, AirPods Max) connected to your Mac **while audio is playing**, and lets macOS auto‑switch normally when audio stops. 

If you’re tired of your AirPods randomly switching to your iPhone or iPad in the middle of work — this is for you.

Glued supports both **Intel** and **Apple Silicon** Macs.
