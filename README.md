# Glued

**Glued** is a tiny macOS menu bar app that keeps your AirPods (AirPods Pro, AirPods Max) connected to your Mac **while audio is playing**, and lets macOS auto‑switch normally when audio stops. 

If you’re tired of your AirPods randomly switching to your iPhone or iPad in the middle of work — this is for you.

Glued supports both **Intel** and **Apple Silicon** Macs.

## What It Does

* 📌 Keeps your selected Bluetooth audio device *“glued”* to your Mac while audio is playing
* 🔁 Allows normal Apple auto‑switching behavior when audio stops
* 🎧 Works with AirPods, AirPods Pro and AirPods Max
* 🧩 Runs quietly in the menu bar
* ⚡ Lightweight, no background services, no ads

---

## How It Works

Glued monitors whether audio is actively playing on your Mac.

* When audio **starts playing** → Glued keeps your chosen Bluetooth device connected
* When audio **stops** → Glued does nothing and allows Apple’s auto‑switching to work as usual

You stay in control — without fighting the system.

## Why Glued?

Apple’s automatic audio switching is great — until it isn’t.

Glued doesn’t replace it.
It simply adds a bit of control when you actually need your audio to stay put.
